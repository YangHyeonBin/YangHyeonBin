## 👋 Hi, I’m @YangHyeonBin

I'm a passionate junior programmer who enjoys building meaningful products with like-minded people.
I strive to create work I truly enjoy, and I’m motivated by the desire to make a positive impact in the world.


### 🌱 Current Role
Frontend engineer at a startup (since Jan 2023)

Enjoy working closely with my team, openly discussing ideas and searching for better solutions together.

### 🚀 Recent Work
Contributed to the relaunch of our SaaS product, now named “[Orblit](https://orblit.space)” (started since Jan 2025)

Migrated our tech stack from Flutter to React, and from Firebase (NoSQL) to Supabase (PostgreSQL-based)
→ This change allowed us to dramatically improve web performance by adopting a relational data structure that suits our growing product needs

Returning to React—a framework I first encountered while learning web development—has reignited my excitement for creating robust, modern web applications

### 👀 What Drives Me
I’m passionate about collaborative development that drives meaningful impact. I love how software can solve real-world problems and enhance daily life!
