- 👋 Hi, I’m @YangHyeonBin

- 🌱 I'm a beginner programmer.
  
  I started studying Python on August 30, 2021.
  
  And I started learning HTML on September 22, 2021, CSS on February 3, 2022, JavaScript on March 28, 2022, React on June 19, 2022.
  
  Started learning Dart on December 10, 2022, Flutter on December 12, 2022.

- 👀 I’m interested in finding some things I like. I really want to work with joy, and want to contribute to the world. And luckly, I came across a company that felt the same way.

- 🌱 Currently working as a developer at a startup! Joined the company on January 3, 2023, and have been working on the project since March.
