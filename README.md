- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @YangHyeonBin

- ðŸŒ± I'm a junior programmer.
  
  I started studying Python on 2021-08-30(August 30th, 2021).
  
  And I started learning HTML on 2021-09-22, CSS on 2022-02-03, JavaScript on 2022-03-28, React on 2022-06-19.
  
  Started learning Dart on 2022-12-10, Flutter on 2022-12-12.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in finding things I like. I really want to work with joy, and want to contribute to the world. And luckly, I got the opportunity to work with like-minded people.

- ðŸŒ± Currently working as an engineer at a startup! Joined the company on 2023-01-03, and have been working on the project since March, 2023. (Still hard working on 2024-09-13 too!)
